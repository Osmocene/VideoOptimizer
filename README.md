# VideoOptimizer
For processing my university lecture videos to learn more efficiently.  
1. Generate a transcript with Microsoft Cognitive Services' Speech Recognition.  
2. Predict still frames from RGB statistics and determine when there is a new slide.  
3. The 'conversion' of a transcript from 1) and images from 2) to a printable (PDF/word) format.  
4. A video player with the ability to skip to the next significantly different slide, and skip sections of silence.
